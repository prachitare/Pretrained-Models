      "Futures and Commodity Market News Digital Brands Group, Inc. Launches Innovative Bespoke Apparel Business After Completing $10 Million IPO (NasdaqGS: DBGI)\n",
      "\n",
      "May 24, 2021 (AB Digital via COMTEX) --\n",
      "\n",
      "There's an innovative company where technology, innovation, and fashion connect. Meet Digital Brands Group, Inc. (NasdaqGS: DBGI), an innovative, forward-thinking digitally-focused apparel company that is changing the rules for how clothing is offered and sold. And the great news is that, for investors, its business model is designed to deliver maximum profits through its low overhead, high margin business model. Their mission is just getting started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital Brands completed a successful $10 million underwritten public offering last week, selling roughly 2.4 million shares of stock at $4.15 per share. Although the stock is trading approximately 30% lower from its offering price, wise investors recognize that with a public float of around 6.8 million shares, combined with warrants sold as part of its IPO, the pressure on the stock will not last long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the recent decline a part of the listing process, where early investors have an opportunity to take money off the table. Don't harbor any ill will, either; these same investors not only want to see their shares move substantially higher but are also the ones that seeded the company's initial capital. Therefore, it's a love-hate relationship, and they deserve a profit as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the short-term pain for new investors also exposes massive opportunities to not only recoup current paper losses but to benefit from gains once DBGI provides some market updates. Keep in mind, with only about seven million shares in the float per Yahoo! Finance, buying interest for even small numbers of shares can have a substantial and positive impact on price.\n",
      "\n",
      "The better news is that the selling should subside, leaving only buyers left to drive the price higher. Investors willing to short a stock with a float the size of DBGI does so at their own peril.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, too, investors saw value when they posted $10 million last week. And if they exercise warrants, they would contribute nearly $10 million more. Why the interest?\n",
      "\n",
      "The short answer is that DBGI is changing the way apparel buying and selling gets done. And if they can seize upon this niche, they can reap tremendous rewards. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct To Consumer And Wholesale Model\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Digital Brands isn't the pioneer of direct-to-consumer sales, the way they are developing their business is. To expedite the process, as part of its ICO, DBGI simultaneously acquired Harper and Jones, LLC., a custom and made-to-measure suiting and sportswear company that provides customers with a range of full-closet customization options. That flagship asset is the initial driver of revenues, but investors should expect several more brands to join the DBGI portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "The better news is that these brands can be sourced, developed, and sold at high margins. In fact, three brands on the company website show products that are fashion-forward and bespoke in design. Those listings, however, also show how DBGI is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its Baily44 line of apparel, for instance, is influenced and inspired by LA's urban architecture and iconic landscapes. More distinguishing, its attire is distinguished by modern details, classic elements, and feminine designs that combine beautiful, luxe fabrics and on-trend designs to create sophisticated ready-to-wear capsules for women on the go. Its Lily Top, a sculpted vegan leather sleeveless top with ponte knit back and zip closure, is a shopper favorite that takes comfort and design to a higher level. And while its designs are compelling and bespoke, investors want bottom-line results. Baily44 is a line that can deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, that's only one brand in a company that has several, with plans to add dozens more in the coming quarters. And the way they plan to grow the company is what attracted investor attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Different Business Model In A Billion-Dollar Sector\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors may like the apparel, but chances are they invested in DBGI to make money. In that case, they may be comforted to know that Digital Brands is a streamlined, low overhead, vertically integrated business that controls a transaction from procurement to sale. That means there are very limited, if any, intermediaries that touch the product and drive up costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, DBGI is leveraging a business model that can offer numerous brands on a direct-to-consumer and wholesale basis by utilizing its founding strategy to be successful as a digitally native-first vertical brand. What does that mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, digital native-first brands are brands founded as e-commerce driven businesses, with online sales being the significant contributor to revenues. As these brands get more popular, they sometimes expand into wholesale or direct retail channels. However, unlike typical e-commerce businesses, like online sellers Naked Brands, Inc. (NasdaqGS: NAKD) and L Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LB), Digital Brands, acting as a digitally native vertical operation, controls its own distribution, sources its products directly from its third-party manufacturers, and sells directly to the end consumer. Thus, the model lends itself to high margin, low overhead sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, to build the business, DBGI needs to cultivate its base. There, as part of the entire process, they focus on owning the customer's \"closet share\" by leveraging shared data and purchasing history to create personalized, targeted content and looks for that specific customer. In other words, DBGI is taking steps to increase loyalty and perhaps even become a shopper's personal stylist.\n",
      "\n",
      "That may veer off track from providing an investment thesis, but it's an important element to understand how and why DBGI can become a much larger company. And with share price directly related to revenues and net profit, knowing that DBGI has the right plan to maximize sales is critical to investor success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the model isn't exclusively online. DBGI has made an effort to strategically expand into an OmniChannel brand, offering styles and content online and at selected wholesale and retail storefronts. The strategy here is to capitalize on peripheral opportunities that can successfully drive Lifetime Value (\"LTV\") while increasing new customer growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Added at the right time and right location, these locations can add considerable revenues to the company. Remember, with a public float as small as DBGI's, even small amounts of revenue can have a powerful value-creating effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with money in the bank and impressive lines of apparel to sell, DBGI can take advantage of a consumer products and apparel market that is expected to surge in the back half of the year as COVID restrictions finally ease. Analysts expect that pent-up demand, combined with stimulus money, will fuel one of the sharpest and most profitable snap-back rallies ever, with the apparel and hospitality sectors being the prime beneficiaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excellent news is that it is starting to happen already.\n",
      "\n",
      "A New Approach In A Crazy Year\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Digital Brands is coming to market at an opportune time. Yes, they have history and have shown success, but as a post-ICO company, investors focus on what the company can do today, tomorrow, and next week. In other words, performance now matters 100% of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the best asset to meet those challenges is its experienced management team that understands style, logistics, social media, and its consumers, in general. Consider this scenario to emphasize that point:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shoppers endlessly walk past full racks of clothing in department and chain stores because the apparel is commoditized, poorly sized, and is designed to fit multiple preferences instead of one. That's okay and serves a purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, other stores are tremendously more profitable by offering well-designed, luxe products that cater to more exclusive preferences beyond color and fabric. And with Digital Brands being the latter, they create a socially conscious, personal business that caters to its clients, not to mass crowds of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while there isn't much data to base a valuation just yet, investors that paid $4.15 a share probably know much more than we do about where DBGI is going. Obviously, they believe its share price is going higher. After looking at the brands, the sales model, and its carefully planned strategies, it's hard not to agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may take a week or two for the early investors to take some money off the table through warrant diversification strategies. Until then, the stock may see some pressure. However, for those looking long-term, these erratic price swings should be less concerning. Digital Brands appears to have a good plan in place to take its company to the next level.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that should be the focus for early investors.\n",

      "‘’Ameria is clearly the best place of the Armenian banks for an IPO today. To fund IPO you need a few things to work. One is you actually need market appetite. So that is not entirely dependent on Ameria. There is a crisis out there so investor appetite, we need to be engaged properly by the arrangers of the transaction. But you also need strong fundamentals. And those strong fundamentals go in two buckets in my view. One that you need is a minimum critical size. Ameria is reaching that minimum critical size which is not easy in the Armenian market because it’s not such a big market. But it is reaching that size. They can actually go and be offering a pool of investors a number of shares that will make it into a meaningful IPO on the international stage. And it’s not just about being big. It’s also about being good. And Ameria has a very good management team has very good products, a good set of clients and so is ready, in my view, for an IPO’’.\n",

      "As has been widely reported, Marqeta, a top Fintech in the card issuance sector, will go public in an initial public offering (IPO) soon after its registration is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The initial S-1 was filed on May 14, 2021, and an amended S-1/A was filed earlier today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marqeta works with both early-stage ventures and established firms connecting these businesses with Visa and Mastercard etc. to create a bespoke program that aligns with the goals of the firm leveraging a series of APIs and services. Marqeta works with firms like Uber, Square, Klarna, Doordash and many others – some you probably have heard of and some perhaps not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 2009 by CEO Jason Gardner, Marqeta has since “evolved into the world’s first open API modern card issuing platform” operating in 36 different countries with over 320 million cards (including virtual ones) issued. The Marqeta IPO is one of the most anticipated Fintech IPOs of 2021 with a reported valuation ranging from $10 billion to $16 billion. A year ago, Marqeta raised $150 million at a valuation of $4.3 billion. The IPO is expected to raise $100 million and trade on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol “MQ.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So what can we learn from Marqeta’s S-1 filed with the SEC?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the S-1, Marqeta has an annualized revenue of $350 million based on Q4 2020 performance. The company experienced over a 100% growth rate in 2020 with about $60 billion in transactions processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To quote the filing on platform revenue:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have grown and scaled rapidly in recent periods. Our total net revenue was $143.3 million and $290.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2020, respectively, an increase of 103%. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, and 2021, our net revenue was $48.4 million and $108.0 million, respectively, an increase of 123%. We incurred net losses of $58.2 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 18%. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, and 2021, we incurred net losses of $14.5 million and $12.8 million, respectively, a decrease of 12%.”\n",

      "Marqeta enables its clients to issue physical, virtual, and tokenized cards. By using Marqeta clients can leverage applications that cover the entire payments lifecycle, including development tools; program administration; and fraud, cases, and chargebacks. The Marqeta platform is described as highly configurable and is able to serve use cases previously unavailable by legacy providers, such as financing at the point-of-sale in the lending industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marqeta sees a global addressable market that will exceed $74 trillion in 2021 or approximately 4 trillion individual payment transactions. As Marqeta processed $60.1 billion (up from $21.7 billion) in 2020, the company holds under 1% of the annual $6.7 trillion of transaction volume conducted through U.S. issuers. So the opportunity could be enormous.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are some of the risks as outlined by the company?\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond execution risk, competition in the sector exists. To quote the document:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We face competition along several dimensions, including providers with legacy technology platforms, such as Global Payments (TSYS), Fiserv (First Data), and Fidelity National Information Services; vertical-focused providers, such as Wex and Comdata; and emerging providers, such as Adyen and Stripe. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include industry expertise, platform and product features and functionality, ability to build new technology and keep pace with innovation, scalability, extensibility, product pricing, security and reliability, brand recognition and reputation, agility, and speed to market. We expect competition to increase in the future as established and emerging companies continue to enter the markets we serve or attempt to address the problems that our Platform addresses. Moreover, as we expand the scope of our Platform, we may face additional competition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A key challenge to the firm and something that has been highlighted elsewhere is the fact that Marqeta currently generates 70% of its revenue from a single customer: Square. Obviously, Marqeta would like to have a more diversified revenue channel. Marqeta states:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2020, Square accounted for 60% and 70% of our net revenue, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, and 2021, we generated 66% and 73%, respectively, of our net revenue from Square. Although we expect the net revenue from our largest Customer will decrease over time as a percentage of our total net revenue as we generate more net revenue from other Customers, we expect that net revenue from a relatively small group of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue in the near term. In the event that any of our largest customers stop using our platform or use our platform in a reduced capacity, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of these customers may adversely affect our reputation and could make it more difficult to attract and retain other customers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Marqeta’s agreements with clients do not typically have long-term requirements meaning a change can take place on short notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marqeta’s anticipated use of funds includes working capital and other general corporate purposes and expanding business globally. Marqeta may use some of the proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services, technologies, or other assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Dear Investor letter, Gardner states the size of the addressable market is staggering:\n",
      "\n",
      "“…most of this volume lives on legacy platforms. Additionally, as people migrate away from using cash, there is just that much more volume to be transacted over modern infrastructure. That’s the opportunity and the target: to disrupt legacy platforms and move that volume to a modern platform like Marqeta. We are at the forefront of a significant secular shift towards modern money movement. We believe that transformation will happen over the next decade and that we are still in the early innings. At scale, the winners in this industry will control the vast majority of the volume. Our job is to build the go-to-market platform that winners default to globally. Over time, we intend to broaden our platform by introducing additional capabilities and functionality to meet our customers’ evolving global money movement needs. Our customers need several solutions beyond cards that we’re looking to bring to them in the future. Why? Because we focus relentlessly on our customers.”\n",

      "NEW DELHI: Quick service restaurants QSR ) are back in news after the operator of Pizza Hut, KFC and Costa Coffee chains Devyani International filed draft papers for Rs 1,400 crore IPO with market regulator Sebi.Covid 2.0 has triggered lower discounting and higher delivery fees by aggregators, alongside a 10-15 per cent reduction in restaurant supply. The developments, analysts said, have improved the value proposition for western QSRs against cloud kitchens and restaurants that thrived on aggregator promotions, suggesting ease in competition for listed QSRs in coming months.ICICI Securities, which analysed Devyani's draft paper in detail, suggestsis the best-in-class QSR across categories. Others, who are tracking Covid 2.0 progress, agree.The brokerage said that pizza as a category does have superior margins than burger.\"We believe Jubilant's superior margin profile is sometimes underappreciated on the pretext that pizza is a high gross margin product vs burgers. Jubilant's two times throughput of Pizza Hut (Devyani) places it at the top in terms of store-level Ebitda margin. Jubilant has been able to double its store throughput in the past 10 years on the back of superior execution. Its less dependence on high-street locations, along with better capex efficiency, gives it the ability to make deeper inroads,\" ICICI Securities said.In case of burger outlets, KFC’s (Devyani) current store-level is 21 per cent lower than Westlife Development's (Mc Donald's) and 8 per cent lower than Burger King's. Westlife had higher throughput than KFC even in 2014, when it was of similar size. The gross margins of all three burger chains are in the range of 64-65 per cent.\"Westlife has delivered well on gross margin expansion despite the overall value focus. Burger King ad spends are slightly higher possibly because they are late entrants while KFC is slightly efficient on other cost structures despite Westlife enjoying the best lease terms,\" ICICI Securities said.In case of coffee chains, while Costa Coffee (Devyani) has cut 23 stores in the past two years, reducing its footprint to 44 stores at the end of FY21, Starbucks has added 75 stores during the same timeframe and now has a network of 221 stores, the brokerage noted.ICICI remains bullish on Jubilant's resilient model and expects it to outperform the food service market. It also likes Westlife on similar grounds, while having 'Add' rating on both the stocks.Other brokerages also have a positive view on Jubilant FoodWorks.CLSA, in a May 18 note, said Jubilant Foodworks has been able to leverage the consumer need for safe options. It has leveraged mass media to promote its contact-less delivery and safety precautions, which has helped consumers in reverting to out of home food options, it said.\"A host of brands and cuisines will help the company create a supper app for delivery and setting up food courts. Important to note, Jubilant has the best delivery execution in the country and the most efficient delivery fleet,\" CLSA said.QSR is likely to be the fastest growing channel, constituting 54 per cent of the total outlets and 34 per cent of the total food services sector in India. Over 2020-2025, the number of industry outlets are expected to grow at 4.5 per cent compounded annually, in which QSR outlets will grow at 6.5 per cent, various projections suggest.\"The pandemic has grown digital adoption, ordering-in habits and acceptance of delivery fees, and weakened tail-restaurant supply and eased competitive intensity. QSRs have used the crisis to improve economics by optimizing their cost structures, store networks and store designs. We expect western QSRs to accelerate store expansion while eating into the market share of unorganised players,\" Kotak said in a May 8 note.This brokerage also likes Jubilant FoodWorks and has initiated coverages on Westlife with 'Add' and Burger King with 'Sell' rating.\n",

      "Book building is the process between issuer and investors, with the assistance of the underwriter, used to ascertain an accurate price for a stock. The main purpose of book building is to ensure a price that reflects the market demand.\n",

      "During the book building process, investors can bid at any price within the price range stated in the disclosure document as well as the amount they wish to subscribe to.

But you also need strong fundamentals. And those strong fundamentals go in two buckets in my view. One that you need is a minimum critical size. Ameria is reaching that minimum critical size which is not easy in the Armenian market because it’s not such a big market. But it is reaching that size. They can actually go and be offering a pool of investors a number of shares that will make it into a meaningful IPO on the international stage. And it’s not just about being big. It’s also about being good. And Ameria has a very good management team has very good products, a good set of clients and so is ready, in my view, for an IPO’’.\n",

      "NOXXON’s oncology-focused pipeline acts on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking the tumor protection barrier and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME, NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and based on the trial results, including overall survival and safety profile, further studies are being planned in pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. A trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit from standard chemotherapy has delivered preliminary data from the first cohort showing consistent tumor reductions. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors.
